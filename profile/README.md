## 🍿 Fun facts
- Joel is insectiphobia. If you are flying insect, or anything that based on insect, please pardon his jumpscare towards you (and probably loss of life), people. He is not racist, just scared of certain bugs, especially cockroaches.
- Joel likes Perkedel. it's fried mash potato. This explains the brand & the name of this company, just like presumably Apple or whatever it is.
- according to most name meaning databases, `Joel` means `son of God`. This probably explains Joel's fear of God, and some of the motive in this company that relates to Christianity.
- Joel is the 1st father of Perkedel Technologies & the kingdom. Joel also is founder of Perkedel Technologies & its stuff that comes from it (notably Perkedel Cinematic Universe).
- Despite Joel being crybaby to this day, his language of crying evolves into even more complicated language as he grows. Right now, it is no longer litteral and can be found on some of his creations. It may needs some times to figure out if this is Joel was crying.

# P.S.
- If you that itch comment against Kart Kids published by SokPop, ignore it! That was Joel's stance against egregious paywall over a too simple game could be a freeware **from serveral years ago**. Today Joel already bought it, despite all the sloppy apology. And peck you, Google!! Rank that down, you cancel culture occultist!!!!
